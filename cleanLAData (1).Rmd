## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(data.table)
library(lubridate)
library(jsonlite)
library(rjson)
library(plyr)
library(chron)
library(dplyr)

#make sure you have this .rmd file in the same directory as where you 
#save our csv file
rawFile <- fread("traffic-collision-data-from-2010-to-present.csv")

#change date occurred, time occurred, and date reported to date formats
rawFile$dateOccured <- rawFile$`Date Occurred`
rawFile$dateOccured <- gsub(x=rawFile$`Date Occurred`,pattern="T00:00:00.000",replacement="",fixed=TRUE)
rawFile$dateReported <- rawFile$`Date Reported`
rawFile$dateReported <- gsub(x=rawFile$`Date Reported`,pattern="T00:00:00.000",replacement="",fixed=TRUE)
rawFile$timeOccurred <- rawFile$`Time Occurred`
lengthRow <- length(rawFile$dateOccured)
rawFile$timeOccurred<- sub("([[:digit:]]{2,2})$", ":\\1", rawFile$timeOccurred) 
rawFile$dateTimeOccurred <- as.POSIXct(paste(rawFile$dateOccured, rawFile$timeOccurred), format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M") 
# this dateTimeOccured wasn't too useful because you couldn't do calculations 
# with it, if we want to look at time of day, we can use the hours as group
# type in one of the applies

rawFile1 <- rawFile[,-2:-4] # remove orignal dates that are not useful
rawFile2<- rawFile1[, c(1,22,24,23,2:21)] #rearrange new columns to beginning of table

# create function to be able to read JSON Location array
storeJSONTxt <- function(jsonText){
store1 <- fromJSON(chartr("\'\"","\"\'",jsonText))
return(store1)
}

# create emtpy dataframe to store results
df <- data.frame (matrix(NA, nrow=length(rawFile2$Location) , ncol=2))
# used lapply to apply function to Location coordinates as the function
# returns a list
df1 <- lapply(rawFile2$Location, storeJSONTxt)

#change list to numeric and delete data that is empty
df <- data.frame(matrix(unlist(df1), nrow=length(rawFile2$Location), byrow=T),stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
df <- df[,-3]

#add longitude and latitude to original table
rawFile2$latitude <- df$X1
rawFile2$longitude <- df$X2

#df[[1000]][[2]]

### add additional time of day information from LA Collission Data RMD

rawFile2$month <- month(rawFile2$dateOccured, label = TRUE)
rawFile2$year <- year(rawFile2$dateOccured)
rawFile2$wday <- wday(rawFile2$dateOccured, label = TRUE)

tt <- strptime(paste("2001-01-01", rawFile2$timeOccurred), format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
tt1 <- format(round(tt, units="hours"), format="%H:%M:%S")

rawFile2$timeOccurredNearestHour <- lapply(tt1, function(x) {as.numeric(times(x))*24})
rawFile2$timeOccurredNearestHour <- as.numeric(rawFile2$timeOccurredNearestHour)
# less than about 3% of our data might be a bit skewed as hour 23:31 to 0:59 are zeroes
rawFile2$timeOccurredNearestHour[is.na(rawFile2$timeOccurredNearestHour)] <- 0


#added useful category for plots, etc. 
yearMonth <- ddply(rawFile2, c( "year", "month" ), summarise, N = length(dateOccured))

#reverse order of months for easier graphing
yearMonth$month <- factor(yearMonth$month, levels=rev(levels(yearMonth$month)))

#added climate data

climateData <- fread("1827343.csv")

# i did not include type of data because a lot of empty data
# i also did not include max sustained windspeed per seconds
# wind speed data is in meters per second
climateTest <- data.frame (climateData$DATE, climateData$AWND, climateData$PRCP, climateData$TMAX, climateData$TMIN, (climateData$TMAX+climateData$TMIN)/2)
names(climateTest) <- c("dateOccured", "averageWindSpeed", "precipitation", "tempMax",
                        "tempMin", "tempAvg")

rawFile2 <- left_join( climateTest, rawFile2, by=c("dateOccured"))
#451491, 478448

rawFile2 <- rawFile2[-451491:-478448,]
rawFile2<- rawFile2[, c(1,32:35,2:31)]

str(rawFile2)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
